the 3 basic ways a TCP connection can fail.

	1) network outage 
	2) The peer application crashes 
	3) The peer's system crashes 

If you use "send()" on a socket that your peer thinks is closed, that peer will respond with an RST message. 
This state is easily detacted by the return value of "recv()". 

A more serious issue to consider is what happens when "send()" is called on a socket that has already received an RST message from its peer. 
On Unix-based systems the defualt is to send a "SIGPIPE" signal to your program. 
if you don't handle this signal the operating system will terminate your program
