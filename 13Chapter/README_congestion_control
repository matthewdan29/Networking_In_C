TCP also implements congestion control methods as part of a network congrestion-avoidance schemem. 
While flow control is vital to prevent overwhelming the reciever, congestion control is essential to prevent overwhelming the network. 

One way TCP congesstion control works is by allowing only a limited amount of data to be sent before pausing to wait for an acknowledgment of receipt. 
This data limit is decreased when network congestion is detected. 

Another way TCP implements congestion control is through the TCP slow start algorithm. 
This method provides a way for TCP to ramp up a connection to its full potential, instead of immediatly dumping a lot of data on the network all at once.
