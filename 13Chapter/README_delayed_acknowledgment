Some TCP stacks implement a delayed acknowledgment method to reduce network congestion. 
This technique works by delaying the acknowledgment of received data. 
The hope is that the receiver is going to send a response very soon anyway, and that the acknowledgment can piggyback on this response. 
When it works, which is often, it conservers bandwidth. 

Now, Consider combining the Nagle algorithm with delayed acknowledgment. 
If the client transmits its request in two small messages, then the sending channel is blocked for not only the round trip time. 
It is also blocked for the additional acknowledgment delay time.
