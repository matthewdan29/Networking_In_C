TCP connections ar full-duplex. 
This means that the data being sent is independent of the data being received. 
Data is sent and received simultaneously. 
This also implies that the connection must be closed by both sides before it is truly disconnected. 
To close a TCP connection, each side sends a Finish (FIN) message and receiveds and ACK message from their peer. 

The exact tear down process, from the perspective of each peer, dependson whether it sent a FIN first, or received a FIN first. 
THere are three basic connection tear donw cases. 

	1) You initiated the tear down by sending the first FIN message. 

	2) You received a FIN mesage from your connection peer. 
	
	3) you and your peer send FIN messages simultaneously

In case 3, where both sides send a FIN message simultaneously, each side thinks that it is in case 1. 
That is each side thinks it has sent the first FIN message, and each side tears down its socket as in case 1. 
This is pretty rare, but certainly possible.

The TCP connection stat transitions on the initiator are "ESTABLISHED", "FIN-WAIT-1", "FIN-WAIT-2", "TIME-WAIT", and "CLOSED". 
The TCP connection stat transitions on the receiveing peer are "ESTABLISHED", "CLOSE-WAIT", "LAST-ACK", and "CLOSED".
