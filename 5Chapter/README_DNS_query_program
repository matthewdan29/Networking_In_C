We will now implement a utility to send DNS queries to a DNS server and receive the DNS response. 
This is a good opportunity to better understand the DNS protocol and to get experience of sending binary UDP packets. 
We egin with a function to print a name from a DNS message. 

Printing a DNS message name
DNS encodes names in a particular way. 
Each label is indicated by its length, followed by its text. 
A number of labels can be repeated, and then the name is terminated with a single 0 byte. 
If a length has its two highest bits set, then it and the next byte should be interpreted as a pointer instead. 
We must also be aware at all times that the DNS response from the DNS server could be ill-formed or corrupted. 
we must try to write our program in such a way that it won't crash if it receives a bad massage.
