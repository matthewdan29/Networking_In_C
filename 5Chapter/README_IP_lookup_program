To demonstrate the "getaddrinfo()" and "getnameinf()" functions, we will implement a short program. 
This program takes a name or IP address for its only argument. 
It then uses "getaddrinfo()" to resolve that name or that IP address into an address structure, and the program prints that IP address using "getnameinfo()" fo rthe text conversion. 
If multiple addresses are associated with a name, it prints each of them. 
It also indicates any errors.
