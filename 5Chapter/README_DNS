client A's DNS server is trying to resolve "www.example.com" as follows: 

	1) If first connects to a root DNS server and asks for "www.example.com". 

	2) The root DNS server directs it to ask the ".com" server. 

	3) Our client's DNS server then connects to the server responsible for ".com" and asks for "www.example.com". 

	4) The ".com" DNS server gives our server the address of another server -- The "example.com" DNS server. 

	5) Our DNS server finally connects to that server and asks about the record for "www.example.com". 

	6) The "example.com" server then shares the address of "www.example.com". 
	
	7) Our client's DNS server relays it back to our client.
