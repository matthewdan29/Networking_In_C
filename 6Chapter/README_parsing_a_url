"web_get.c" is a C function to parse a given URL. 
The function takes as input a URL, and it returns as output the hostname, the port number, and the document path. 
To avoid needing to do manual memory management, the outputs are returned as pointers to specific parts of the input URL. 
The input URL is modified with terminating NULL pointers as required. 
This program is useful for debugging.
