	1) "GET" is used when the client wants to download a resource. 

	2) "HEAD" is just like "GET", except that the client only wants information about the resource instead of the resource itself. 

	3) "POST" is used when the client needs to send information to the server. 
	Your web broswer typically uses a "POST" request when you submit an online form, for example posting a commint on a social media site. 

	4) "PUT" is used to send a document to the seb server.

	5) "DELETE" is rarely used. trust me your server DB will have triggers

	6) "TRACE" is used to request diagnostic information from web proxies. 

	7) "CONNECT" is sometimes used to initiate an HTTP connection throught a proxy server. 

	8) "OPTIONS" is used to ask which HTTP request types are supported by the server for a given resource. 

/*IF you send a request that the web server doesn't support, then the server should respond with a "400 BAD REQUEST" code*/
