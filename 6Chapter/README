Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the pplication protocol that powers the World Wide Web. 
Whenever you fire up your web browser to do an internet search, browse wikipedia, or make a post on social media, you are using HTTP. 
Many mobile apps also use HTTP behind the scenes. 
Its safe to say that HTTP is one of the most widely used protocols on the internet. 

Look at my first github Mattdan29 you will see a great example of how powerful HTTPS is and what it can do now with a little CSS.
