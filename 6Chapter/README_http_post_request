An HTTP "POST" request sends data from the web client to the web server. 
Unlike an HTTP "GET" request, a "POST" request includes a body containing data. 

The "POST" body format can vary, and it should be indentified by a "Content-Type" header. 
Many modern, web-best APIs expect a "POST" body to be JSON encoded.
