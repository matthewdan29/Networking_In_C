In this chapter, we will look at how to send and receive User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. 
UDP socket programming is very similar to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket programing. 

The following topics are covered in this chapter: 

	1) The "sendto()" and "recvfrom()" functions
	2) How "connect()" works on a UDP socket
	3) implementing a UDP server using only one socket
	4) Using "select()" to tell when a UDP socket has data ready
