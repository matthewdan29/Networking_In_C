UDP sockets don't need the "listen()", "accept()", or "connect()" functions calls. 
This mostly because "sendt()" and "recvfrom()" deal with the address directly. 
For more complcated programs, we  can still use the "select()" functions to see which sockets are ready for i/o. 

UDP sockets are connectionless. This is in contrast to connection-oriented TCP sockets. 
With TCP, we had to establish a connectin before sedning data, but with UDP, we simply send individual packets directly to a destination address. 
This keeps UDP socket programming simple, but it can complicate application protocol design, and UDP does not automatically retry commucation failures or ensure that packets arrive in order.
