it will be useful to look at a UDP server that's been designed to service many connections. 
The UDP socket api makes this very easy

Our server begins by setting up the socket and binding to our local address. 
It then waits to recieve data. 
Once it has received a data string it converts the string into all uppercasse and sends it back. 

Just like the TCP server.
