SMTP is a text-based TCP protocol that works on port 25. 

In a typical session, the dialog goes as follows: 
1) The client first establishes a connection to the SMTP server. 
2) The server initiates with a greeting. This greeting indicates that the server is ready to receive commands. 
3) The client then issues it own greetings. 
4) The server responds. 
5) The client sends a command indicating who the mail is from. 
6) The server responds to indicate that the sender is accepted. 
7) The client issues another command, which specifies the mail's recipietn. 
8) The server responds indicating the recipient is accepted. 
9) The client then issues a "DATA" command. 
10) The server responds asking the client to proceed. 
11) the client transfers the email.
