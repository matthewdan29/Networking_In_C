Wi-Fi is the most popular Wireless local Area Network (Wlan) technology and is based around the IEEE 802.11 standards. 
it typically operates on either a 2.4 GHZ or a 5 GHZ radio frequency. 

Two main operation modes are provided by WiFi. 
ad hoc mode, devices communicate directly to one another. 
Infrastructure mode is much more common. 
Devices on a WLAN all connect to a Wireless Access Point (WAP). 
The WAP (lol) then generally provides internet access for the whole WLAN.
