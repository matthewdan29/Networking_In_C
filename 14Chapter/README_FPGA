Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are integrated circuits containing arrays of programmable locgic blocks.
These logic blocks can be programmed and combined to implement complex functions. Essentially, any logic that an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) can perfrom can also be don on an FPGA. 

FPGAs are useful for highly demanding processing tasks requiring real time guarantees, especially tasks that benefit from highly-parallel processing. 
A video-processing algorithm that is too demanding for a single board computer, much less a microcomtrollor may be trivaial fro FPGA. 

FPGAs are programmed using Hardware Description Languages (HDL). 
The two most common languages uses are Verilog and VHSIC hardware Description Language (VHDL).
