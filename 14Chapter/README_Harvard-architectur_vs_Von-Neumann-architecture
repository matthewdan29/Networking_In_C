The Von Neumann Architecture, which dominates the desktop processor market, memory stores both data and insturction. 
this necessitates that processor instructions are the same width as the data they are processing. 
Harvard architecture machines, by contrast, use completely separte memories to store instructions and data. 
It is common for Harvard architecture microcontroller to use different word sizes for instructions compared to data. 
For example, a 16-bit Harvard architecture microcontroller may process data in 16 bit words, but its instructions could be encoded as 24-bit words. 
While data is stored in RAM, instructions are read directly from non-volatile memory, such as FLASH or EEPROM.
