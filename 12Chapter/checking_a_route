				Traceroute

While Ping can tell you whether a network path exits between twon systems, traceroute can reveal what this path actually is. 
Think of a graph and every router is a vertex and the dx/dy of the distance is the edge (This way of thinking leads into GPS systems and that where you should be going). 
In such you can be able to locate anyone with a computer at anytime with the right way of thinking. 

Traceroute is used with on argument: the hostname or address you want to map a route to. 

On Windows, traceroute is called tracert. 
Tracert works in the same way as found on other OS

The traceroute utility uses TTL to identify intermediate routers in a network. 
Trace route begins by addressing a message to the destination host. 
However, traceroute sets the TTL field to a value of 1. 
When the very first router in the connection path receives this message, it decrements TTL to zero. 
The router then realize that the message has expired and discards it. 
A well-behaved router then sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the original sender. 
Traceroute uses this Time Exceeded message to identify the first router in the connection.
