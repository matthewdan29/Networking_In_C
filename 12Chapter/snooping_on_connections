			Getting data sent and receiving data. 

	1) TCPDUMP is a commonly used program for packet capture on Unix-based systems.  
	2) Wireshark is a very popular network protocol analyzer that includes a GUI. wireshark is under the GNU GPL licence, and is on many platforms

You first need to decide which network interfaces you want to use to capture traffic. 
The desired interface or interfaces are passed to tshark with the "-i". 
You can listen to all interfaces by passing "-i any" 
Tshark lists the available interfaces with the "-D" flag. 
If you want to capute only traffic to or from the IP address "0.0.0.0" you will use the "-i host 0.0.0.0" filter.
Tshark filters also support the Boolean operators "and" "or" and "not".
