Netstat is useful to know what connections are being made on your local machine. 
Running "$ netstat -n" prevents netstat from doing reverse-DNS lookups on each address and has the effect of speeding it up significantly. 

"netstat -nt" on linux shows open TCP connections

The queue information, displayed on Unix-based systems, represents how many bytes the kernel has queued up wating for the program to read, or the number of bytes sent but not acknowledged by the foreign host. 
Samll numbers are ok, but if these numbers became large, it could indicate a problem with the network or a bug in the program. 

It is also useful to see which program is responsible for each connection. 
"-p" on unix based systems and "-o" on windows. 
"netstat -ntlp" shows listening TCP server sockets, including the program name
