The socket programming API does provide access to raw sockets, in theory. 
With raw sockets, a C program can construct the exact IP packet to send. 
That is a C programmer could construct an ICMP packet from scratch and send it over the network. 
Raw sockets also allow for programs to receive uninterpreted packets from the network directly. 
In this case, the user program would be responsible for deconstructing and interpreting the ICMP packet, not the operating system.
