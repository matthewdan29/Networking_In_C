Firewalls come in two types: software and hardware. 
Most operationg systems provide software firewalls now. 
Software firewalls are typically configured to deny incoming connections unless a rule is set up to allow it explicitly. 

It is also possible to configure software firewalls to deny outgoing traffic by default. 
Programs aren't allowed to establish new connections unless a specific rule is added to the firewal configuration firt. 

Hardware firewalls come with various capabilityes. 
Often they are configured to block any incoming connections that don't match predefined rules. 
On networks without firewalls, routers often implicitly serve this same purpose. 
If your router provides network address translation (NAT), then it wouldn't even know what to do with an incoming connection unless a port forwarding rule has been pre-established for it. (remember TCP clients have to connect first but UDP servers can just send out data)
