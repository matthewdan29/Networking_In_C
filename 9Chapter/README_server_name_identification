Server Name Indication (SNI). 
SNI is a technique that, when used by TLS, requires the client to indicate to the server which domain it is attempting to connect to. 
The server can then find a matching certificate to use the TLS connection.

It should be noted that SNI involves sending the unencrypted domain name over the network. 
This means an eavesdropper can see which host the client is connecting to, even though they wouldn't know which resources the client is requesting from that host. 
Newer protocols, such as Encrypted Server Name Identification (ESNI), address this problem but not widely deployed yet.
