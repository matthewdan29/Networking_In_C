	1) Authentication: Need a way to prevent imposters from posing as legitimate communication partners.
TSL provides peer authentication methods for this reason. 

	2) Encryption: TLS uses encryption to obfuscate transmitted data. 
This prevents an eavesdropper from correctly interpreting intercepted data. 

	3) Integrity: TLS also ensures that received data has not been tampered with or otherwise forged. 

HTTP is most commonly used to transmit web pages. 
The text on a web page is first encoded as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
HTML provides formatting, layout, and styleing to web pages. 
HTTP is then used to transmit the HTML, and HTTP itself is transmitted over TCP connection. 

TLS works inside TCP to provide a secure communication channel. 
HTTPS is then basically the same as the HTTP protocol, but it is sent inside a TLS channel.
