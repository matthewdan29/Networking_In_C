Each HTTPS server uses one or more certificates to verify their identity. 
This certificate must either be turted by the client itself or trusted by a third party that the client trusts. 
In common usages, such as web browsers, it's not really possible to list all trusted certificates. 
For this reason , it's most common to validate certificates by verifying that a trusted third party trusts them. 
This is proven using digital signatures.
