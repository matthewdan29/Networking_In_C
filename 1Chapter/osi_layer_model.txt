	Physical(1): This is the level of physical communication in the real world. 
At this level, you have specifications for things such as the voltage levels on an ethernet cable, what each pin on a connector is for, the radio frequency of Wi-Fi, and the light flashes over an optic fiber. 

	Data Link(2): This level builds on the physical layer. 
It deals with protocals for directly communicating between two nodes. 
It defines how a direct message between nodes starts and end (framing), error detection and correction, and flow control. 

	Network layer(3): The network layer provides the methods to transmit data sequences (called packets) between nodes in differenct networks. It provides methods to route packets from one node to another (without a direct physical connection) by transferring through many intermediate nodes. 
This is the layer that the Internet Protocal is defined on, which you will go into in some depth later. 

	Transport layer(4): At this layer, we have methods to reliably deliver variable length data between hosts.
These methods deal with dplitting up data, recombining it, ensuring data arraves in order, and so on. 
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are commonly said to exit on this layer 

		Session layer(5): This layer builds on the transport layer by adding methods to establish, checkpoint, suspend, and resume, and terminate dialogs. 

	Presentation layer(6): This is the lowest layer at which data structure and presentation for an applicatoin are defined. Concerns such as data encoding, serialization, and encryption are handled here. 

	Application layer(7): The applications that the user interfaces with exits here. These applications make use of the services provided by the six lower layers.
