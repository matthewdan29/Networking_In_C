SSH uses strong encryption to protect against eavesdropping. 
SSH allows clients to verify servers identities using public-key authentication. 
Without public-key authentication of the server, an imposter oculd masquerade as a legitimate server and attempt to trick a client into connecting. 
Once connected, the client would send its credentails to the imposter server. 

SSH also provides many methods for client authentication with servers. 
These include sending a password or using public-key authentication.
