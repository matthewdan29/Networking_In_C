	1) No authentication: This allows any user to connect 

	2) Password authentication: This requires the user to provide a username and password 

	3) Public key: this uses public key encryption methods to authenticate 

	4) keyboard-interactive: this authenticates by having the user answer several prompts 

	5) generic security service application program ingerface (GSS-API): this allows authentication through a variety of other services.
