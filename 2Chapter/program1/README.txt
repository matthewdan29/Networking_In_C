This DIR was made to display an example task, we are going to build a web server that tells you what time it is right now. 
This could be a useful resource for anybody with a smartphone or web browser that needs to know what time it is right now. 
They can simply navigate to the web page and find out. 
This is a good first example because it does something useful but still trivial enough that it won't distract.
