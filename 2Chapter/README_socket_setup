Before you acn use the socket API, you need to include the socket API header files. 
These files vary depending on whether you are using Barkeley sockets or Winsock. 
Additionally, winsock requires initialization before use. 
It also requires that a cleanup function is called when we are finished. 
These initialization and cleanup steps are not used in Berkely sockets. 

You will use the C preprocessor to run the proper code on Windows compared to Berkeley socket system. By using the preprocessor statement, "#if defined(_WIN32)", you can include code in our program that will only be compiled on Windows.
