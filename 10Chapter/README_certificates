Certificates are an important part of the TLS protocol. 
Althought certificates can be used on both the client and server side, HTTPS generally only uses server certificates. 
These certificates identify to the client that they are connected to a trusted server. 

Without vertificates, a client wouldn't be able to tell whether it was connected to the intended server or an impostor server. 

Certificates work using a chain of trust model.
