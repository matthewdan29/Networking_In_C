Generally, HTTPS connections are first made using TCP sockets. 
Once the TCP connection is established, OpenSSL is used to negotiate a TLS connection over the open TCP connection. 
From that point forward, OpenSSL functions are used to send and received data over the TLS connection. 

TLS uses certificates to prevent against connecting to imposters and man in the middle attacks.
